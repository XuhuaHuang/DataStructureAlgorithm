## `Algorithms`
Contains both implementation and demonstration of popular algorithms.  
For specific lines of instruction of each source file, consult the documentation section in each individual source code file.
* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort

## `DataStructures`
Contains both implementation and demonstration of popular data structures using trival data types like `int` or `double`.  
For specific lines of instruction of each source file, consult the documentation section in each individual source code file.
* Hash table
* Sequential list
* Singly linked list
* Stack

## `GenericDataStructures
Template implementation of commonly seen data structures in C++ with `CMake` and test cases.
* Double linked list
* Linked list
